This is a short test post to make sure that this [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) based site is build right. Consist of some common typography and code block's styles test to make sure that the `css` rendered correctly.

Started with this very typical typography test of **bold**, _italic_, and the combination of **_both_** text. Then the below code block's styles test wrapped in `<pre>` tag applied to this [Hello World!](#) test post, which set its content `<meta>` to `<noindex>`.

Here's the two:

1. `if ignore` goes inside `<head>` tag of the `base.njk` layout

```html/4-6
<!-- _includes/layouts/base.njk -->

<head>
...
{%raw%}{% if ignore %}
   <meta name="robots" content="noindex"/>
{% endif %}{%endraw%}
...
</head>
```

2. `ignore:true` _key-value_ pairs goes to the post's `front-matter`

```diff-yml
# posts/hello-world.md
