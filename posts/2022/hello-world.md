This is a short test post to make sure that this [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) based site build's is right. Consist of some common typography and code block's styles test to make sure that the `css` rendered correctly. 

Started by this typical typography test of **bold** text, _italic_, and the combination of **_both_**. Then the code block's style test wrapped in `<pre>` tag applied to this [Hello World!](#) test post to set its content `<meta>` to `<noindex>`.

Here's the code and the steps:  
1. Add the below highlighted code block inside `<head>` tag to the `base.njk` layout

```html/4-6
<!-- _includes/layouts/base.njk -->

<head>
...   
{%raw%}{% if ignore %}
   <meta name="robots" content="noindex"/>
{% endif %}{%endraw%}
</head>
```

2. Add `ignore:true` _key-value_ pairs to the `hello-world.md` post's `front-matter` like so

```diff-yaml
/* posts/hello-world.md */
